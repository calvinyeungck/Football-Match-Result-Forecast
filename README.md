# Interpretable model for forecasting football match results
Data scource for this Project: European Soccer Database (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer) and European Soccer Database Supplementary (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jiezi2004/soccer).

The following documents are the code and dataset for the proposed model (Yeung et al., 2022).

1. datav7.xlsx and data_tree.xlsx are the datasets for predicting match statistics (LR) and match result forecast (XGBoost) respectively.

2. LR.py and Tree.py are the code for predicting match statistics (LR) and match result forecast (XGBoost) respectively.
