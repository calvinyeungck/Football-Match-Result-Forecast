# Interpretable model for forecasting football match results
Data scource for this Project: European Soccer Database (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer) and European Soccer Database Supplementary (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jiezi2004/soccer)

The following documents are the code and dataset for the proposed model in (Yeung et al., 2022)

datav7.xlsx and data_tree.xlsx are the dataset for predicting match statistics and xGboosting Tree respectivly

LR.py and Tree.py are the code for predicting match statistics and xGboosting Tree respectivly
