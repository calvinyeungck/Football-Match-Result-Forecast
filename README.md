# Generalized and interpretable machine learning model with coach’s decision and players’ quality features for football match result forecast
Data sources for this Project: European Soccer Database (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer) and European Soccer Database Supplementary (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jiezi2004/soccer).

The code and dataset for the proposed model (Yeung et al., 2022) are contained in the following files.

1. data_LR.xlsx and data_tree.xlsx are the datasets for predicting the match statistics (LR) and for match result forecasting (XGBoost), respectively.

2. The LR.py and Tree.py scripts contain the code for predicting the match statistics (LR) and for match result forecasting (XGBoost), respectively.
